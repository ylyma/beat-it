# BeatIt

Orbital Project Repo for Amy and Ivan

## Project Description

### Motivation

Having just picked up dance at the start of university, we faced many challenges when trying to learn choreography. Some examples are when reviewing videos you filmed of yourself, the audio is muffled because the phoneâ€™s mic is not that good, causing it to be hard to hear the intricacies in the music that you can hear in real life, or having to scrub back and forth in the music countless times and memorising which timestamp to scrub to.

So something we would like to do is to create an app that makes dance practices more efficient and productive, and to make dancing easier to pick up. We hope to learn more about UI/UX as well as mobile app development through this experience, to make a simple and intuitive interface that reduces friction in user adoption. Once completed, we will be publishing it on the Play Store and continue using it personally.

### Vision

BeatIt will be an app that dancers can use to make their practice sessions more efficient and productive, and make it easier to teach dance to beginners. It will be something that is intuitive for dancers to use and not obstruct or slow down their current practices.

Some features we have planned for it include automatic audio replacement in recorded videos, bookmarking different timestamps in music for quick scrubbing, and annotations that can be placed on videos and shared with others.

These features will allow dancers to spend their time more productively, rather than trying to find the right timestamp to scrub to, or to provide feedback to others quickly.
